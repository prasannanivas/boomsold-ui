# Missing Data Analysis - Montreal Neighborhoods

## Summary

Comparing the **GeoJSON map data** with **neighborhood-prices.json**, here's what's missing:

---

## 📊 Current Status

### Total Neighborhoods in Map (GeoJSON)

**18 unique neighborhoods** found in `quartierreferencehabitation_merged.geojson`

### Total Neighborhoods in Price Data (JSON)

**33 neighborhoods** found in `neighborhood-prices.json`

---

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: Your map has FEWER neighborhoods than your price data!

This means you have **extra pricing data** for neighborhoods that aren't even on the map. The map only shows the main Montreal boroughs.

## ⚠️ Missing CONDO Prices

Only **2 neighborhoods** are missing condo price data:

1. **Hampstead**

   - Single Family: $2,043,529 ✅
   - Condo: ❌ **NULL** (very wealthy area, possibly has few/no condos)

2. **Senneville**
   - Single Family: $1,550,500 ✅
   - Condo: ❌ **NULL** (rural area, possibly has few/no condos)

**Why missing?** These are very wealthy, low-density areas that may have very few condo developments or insufficient sales data.

## 📝 Name Mapping Issues

The `nameMapping` in `Utils.js` maps CSV names to GeoJSON names. Check these potential mismatches:

1. **"Ahuntsic–Cartierville"** (CSV) → **"Ahuntsic-Cartierville"** (GeoJSON) ✅ Mapped correctly
2. **"Pierrefonds–Roxboro"** (CSV) → **"Pierrefonds-Roxboro"** (GeoJSON) ✅ Mapped correctly
3. **"L'Île-Bizard - Sainte-Geneviève"** (CSV) → **"L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève"** (GeoJSON) ✅ Mapped correctly
4. **"Montréal (Saint-Laurent)"** (CSV) → **"Saint-Laurent"** (GeoJSON) ✅ Mapped correctly

## 🎯 What Actually Needs Fixing?

### NOTHING IS BROKEN! 🎉

All the neighborhoods that **appear on your map** have pricing data. The extra pricing data is for independent cities that aren't part of the main Montreal borough map.

### Optional Improvements:

1. **Fill in missing condo prices** for Hampstead and Senneville (if data exists)
2. **Consider adding independent cities** to your map if you want to show West Island municipalities
3. **Current setup is fine** - Your map focuses on Montreal boroughs, which all have complete pricing data

## 🔍 Data Completeness Report

### For Map Neighborhoods (18): **100% Complete** ✅

- All 18 neighborhoods on the map have both single family and condo prices
- No missing data for any visible area

### For All Price Data (33): **94% Complete** ✅

- 31/33 have both single family and condo prices
- 2/33 are missing condo prices only (Hampstead, Senneville)
- All 33 have single family prices

---

## 🎨 Recommendation

**No action required!** Your current setup is working perfectly. The map displays the main Montreal boroughs with complete pricing data. The extra pricing data is good to have for potential future expansion.

If you want to show the West Island municipalities, you'd need to add them to your GeoJSON file.
